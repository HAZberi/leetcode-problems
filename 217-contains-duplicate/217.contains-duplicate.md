**Notes:**

1. The brute force solution requires you to use nested loop to perform the comparision.
2. In brute force solution, the outer loop picks up an element and then the nested loop starts and compare it with every single value in the array. If the same value exists at a different index, we will simply return true.
3. The edge case in the brute force solution is to make sure that same index comparision is not allowed. Happens once every time the nested loop runs.
4. The next possible solution with a better time complexity of O(nlogn) is to sort the array. When the array is sorted, we loop over it and just compare the neighbors. If any of the neighbours are same, we simply return true.
5. Space complexity in both above solutions is O(1).
6. The most optimal solution make use of a HashSet. The time complexity is reduced to just O(n) but the there is tradeoff, the space complexity is also O(n) as well. Becuause we are using a second data structure.
7. When copying the given list in the hash set use check if the element already exists in the set.
