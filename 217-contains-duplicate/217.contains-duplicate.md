**Notes:**

1. The brute force solution requires you to use nested loop to perform the comparision.
2. In brute force solution, the outer loop picks up an element and then the nested loop starts and compare it with every single value in the array. If the same value exists at a different index, we will simply return true.
3. The edge case in the brute force solution is to make sure that same index comparision is not allowed. Happens once every time the nested loop runs.
