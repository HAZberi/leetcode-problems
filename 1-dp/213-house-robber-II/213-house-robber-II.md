**Notes:**

1. The problem asks us to find the maximum amount that can be robbed from a circular street of houses. Given is a list of money that each house contains. Houses that are adjacent to each other cannot be robbed. We must skip a house after robbing one house.
2. This problem is very similar to Leetcode 198. House Robber. The only difference is that in that problem we had a linear street of houses. In this problem we have a circular street. It means we cannot rob the first and last house in the given list, because these houses are adjacent. The rest of the problem is exactly the same.
3. So inorder to incorporate the circular street. The best thing we can do is reuse the exact solution from the first problem. We can create two subarrays, one without the first house and second without the last house. Then we can seprately run the solution on both of these subarray and take the maximum of the results of these two subarrays. This way we are not robbing the first and last houses. But we have the choice between robbing the first house or the last house. Whichever yields the most we pick it.
4. But in hang there is one more edge case here. What if there is only one house on the street. Then the first house is also the last house. We will be passing empty subarrays to helper function, which will retrun 0. So when we take the maximum of two subarrays we also take the max of that with the house with subarrays and only then retrun the result.
